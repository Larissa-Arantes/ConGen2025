# ConGen 2025 - Genetic diversity tutorial

## Introduction

Heterozygosity is a simple and informative statistic that can be obtained by analyzing whole-genome data. You can calculate the average heterozygosity of an individual or assess the local heterozygosity throughout the genome to answer more specific questions.

There are many methods available to achieve this. In this tutorial, we will use two strategies. To obtain the average heterozygosity, we will manipulate the VCF file using bcftools. To explore heterozygosity variation across the genome, we will use ANGSD and other associated tools.

### Average heterozygosity

#### a) Use the following script to calculate the average heterozygosity per individual:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# FILENAME:  avg_het
#SBATCH -A bio240351  # Allocation name
#SBATCH --nodes=1         # Total # of nodes (must be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1        # Total # of MPI tasks (should be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --time=1:30:00    # Total run time limit (hh:mm:ss)
#SBATCH -J avg_het     # Job name
#SBATCH -o /home/YOUR_USERNAME/logs/avg_het.o%j      # Name of stdout output file
#SBATCH -e /home/YOUR_USERNAME/logs/avg_het.e%j      # Name of stderr error file
#SBATCH -p wholenode  # Queue (partition) name
#SBATCH --mail-user=x-YOUR_USERNAME@anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=all   # Send email to above address at begin and end of job

#Load bcftools
module load biocontainers/default
module load bcftools/1.17

#Define path to input files - do not change it
VCF_FILE="/home/x-larantes/00_raw_data/elephants.chr.11.12.subset.vcf.gz"
POPFILE="/home/x-larantes/x_scripts/popfile.txt"
GENOME_LENGTH="152468515" #Sum of the chromosome lengths included in this analysis

#Make a directory for saving outputs. Replace it with your actual username
OUTPUT_PATH="/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/05_heterozygosity"
mkdir $OUTPUT_PATH

#Define the output name. Replace it with your actual username
OUTPUT_FILE="/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/05_heterozygosity/elephants_heterozygosity.tsv"

#Get a list of sample names from the VCF file
SAMPLES=$(bcftools query -l $VCF_FILE)

#Write a header line to the output file
echo -e "Sample\tHeterozygous_sites\tHeterozygosity" > $OUTPUT_FILE

#Loop through each sample and calculate the heterozygosity
for SAMPLE in $SAMPLES; do
  HETEROZYGOUS=$(bcftools view -s $SAMPLE $VCF_FILE | grep -v "#" | grep -o "0/1" | wc -l)
  HETEROZYGOSITY=$(echo "scale=7; $HETEROZYGOUS / $GENOME_LENGTH" | bc)
  echo -e "$SAMPLE\t$HETEROZYGOUS\t$HETEROZYGOSITY" >> $OUTPUT_FILE
done

#Add population origin of each sample to the heterozygosity file
awk 'NR==FNR {pop[$1]=substr($0, index($0, $2)); next} FNR==1 {print $0"\tPopulation"} FNR>1 {print $0"\t"pop[$1]}' $POPFILE $OUTPUT_FILE > temp && mv temp $OUTPUT_FILE
```

This is a bash script that calculates the heterozygosity of each sample in a VCF file. It uses the bcftools command line tool to extract the list of sample names and calculate the number of heterozygous variants for each sample. The results are written to a tab-separated file with the name "heterozygosity.tsv" and two columns: "Sample" and "Heterozygosity". Then, the last command line add a last column with population origin of each individual. 
Copy this script to a file, give a name that ends with `.sh`, and run it on Anvil using `sbatch command.sh`.

#### b) Plot the results using the R

You can plot it with R in your local computer or using the interactive mode in the server.
If you decide to use your own computer, copy the file `elephants_heterozygosity.tsv` to your local computer using `scp`.
If you decide to use Anvil interact mode (login with `scp -X`), load the R module using `module load r/4.1.0` and then open R typing `R` in the terminal.

```r
# Call ggplot library
library(ggplot2)

# Choose the working directory
setwd("/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/heterozygosity/")

# Define the input file
INPUT_FILE <- "/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/heterozygosity/elephants_heterozygosity.tsv"

# Read in the data from the input file
data <- read.table(INPUT_FILE, header=TRUE, sep="\t")

# Create a boxplot for heterozygosity by population
plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Population, y=Heterozygosity, color=Population)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, width=0.6, alpha=0.6, color="black") +  # Boxplot without outliers, adjust box width and transparency
  geom_jitter(size=2, width=0.1, alpha=0.7) +  # Jittered dots for each individual with some horizontal spacing
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1)) +  # Angle the x-axis labels for better readability
  labs(x="Population", y="Heterozygosity", color="Population") +
  scale_color_discrete(name="Population")  # Color legend for populations

# Save the plot to a file
ggsave("heterozygosity_boxplot_by_population.png", plot, width=10, height=6, dpi=300)

# Show the plot
print(plot)

# Open with interactive mode
svg("heterozygosity_boxplot_by_population.svg", width=10, height=6)
print(plot)
dev.off()
```

This R code block generates a boxplot of heterozygosity values, grouping individuals by population, using data from a tab-separated value (TSV) file. The ggplot2 library is loaded, and the name of the input file is specified. The data is read in using the read.table function, and a boxplot is created using ggplot with "Populations" on the x-axis and "Heterozygosity" on the y-axis. The resulting plot is saved as a png file named "heterozygosity_boxplot_by_population.png".

### Genome-wide heterozygosity

Another way to display heterozygosity is by using a window-based approach. This approach allows for the visualization of variation throughout the genome and the ability to focus on regions of particularly high or low diversity. It also permits comparison of results with other methods, such as Runs of Homozygosity (RoH). There are several software programs that can perform this task in a similar way, including ANGSD.

ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data) is an open-source software designed to analyze low-depth Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Developed by researchers at the University of Copenhagen, ANGSD was specifically designed to handle large-scale sequencing data, particularly from non-model organisms. ANGSD provides a flexible and efficient framework for analyzing complex genomic data, enabling researchers to perform various types of population genetics and genomics analyses.

Key capabilities of ANGSD include:

1.  Genotype calling: ANGSD can estimate genotype likelihoods from sequencing data without actually calling genotypes, which helps reduce biases and errors introduced by hard genotype calls.
2.  SNP discovery: The software can identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and estimate their allele frequencies while accounting for sequencing errors and varying levels of sequencing depth.
3.  Genetic association studies: ANGSD can perform Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and estimate genotype-phenotype associations using mixed linear models or generalized linear models.
4.  Population structure: ANGSD can estimate population structure and admixture proportions using principal component analysis (PCA) or model-based approaches.
5.  Selection scans: The software can detect signals of positive or balancing selection, using various statistics like FST, Tajima's D, and nucleotide diversity.
6.  Handling of various file formats: ANGSD can work with various input file formats, including BAM, CRAM, and VCF files, and output results in multiple formats suitable for downstream analyses.

Overall, ANGSD is a versatile and powerful tool for analyzing NGS data, particularly for non-model organisms or low-coverage sequencing projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of analysis tools that cater to various research objectives in population genetics and genomics.

#### a) Run heterozygosity and realSFS with ANGSD using the bash script below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# FILENAME:  genome_wide_het
#SBATCH -A bio240351  # Allocation name
#SBATCH --nodes=1         # Total # of nodes (must be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1        # Total # of MPI tasks (should be 1 for serial job)
#SBATCH --time=1:30:00    # Total run time limit (hh:mm:ss)
#SBATCH -J genome_wide_het     # Job name
#SBATCH -o /home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/logs/genome_wide_het.o%j      # Name of stdout output file
#SBATCH -e /home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/logs/genome_wide_het.e%j      # Name of stderr error file
#SBATCH -p wholenode  # Queue (partition) name
#SBATCH --mail-user=x-YOUR_USERNAME@anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=all   # Send email to above address at begin and end of job

#Load angsd
module load biocontainers/default
module load angsd/0.940

#Choose individual
SAMPLE="SE2109" #CH0893 and SE2109

#Choose the output directory
output_directory="/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/heterozygosity"

#Set variables. Do not change this part.
input_bam_file="/home/x-larantes/00_raw_data/${SAMPLE}.loxAfr4_NC000934"
ancestral_fasta_file="/home/x-larantes/00_raw_data/loxAfr4.fasta"
reference_fasta_file="/home/x-larantes/00_raw_data/loxAfr4.fasta"

#Loop through scaffolds 11 to 14

for chr in {11..14}; do

    #Run ANGSD
    angsd -P 1 -i ${input_bam_file}_${chr}.bam -anc ${ancestral_fasta_file} -dosaf 1 -gl 1 -C 50 -minQ 20 -minmapq 30 -out ${output_directory}/$SAMPLE.chr_${chr} -ref ${reference_fasta_file}

    #Run realSFS
    realSFS -nsites 200000 ${output_directory}/$SAMPLE.chr_${chr}.saf.idx -fold 1 > ${output_directory}/$SAMPLE.chr_${chr}.est.ml

done
```

Replace the `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your Anvil username, define the path where the output files will be saved, and choose a `$SAMPLE` variable to start running it. Run it for two samples: `CH0893` and `SE2109`.
Because of our time and resource limitations, we are running this analysis only for 4 short chromosomes, from chr 11 to chr 14.
This script will loop through chromosomes 11 to 14, running the ANGSD command and then the realSFS command for each chromosome.
ANGSD will calculate the site allele frequency (SAF) likelihood based on individual genotype likelihoods assuming HWE. It generates 3 output binary files (angsdput.saf.idx, angsdput.saf.pos.gz and angsdput.saf.gz).
realSFS will run an optimization of the .saf file, which will estimate the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). We are estimating it in windows of a fixed number of sites (200,000 bp). It generates an output file .est.ml, which we will further manipulate to plot the results.

Make sure you understand each option in the ANGSD command line:

-   `P <threads>` \- Sets the number of threads to be used in parallel.
-   `i <input_bam_file>` \- Specifies the input file as a BAM file.
-   `anc <ancestral_fasta_file>` \- Specifies the ancestral fasta reference file.
-   `dosaf <dosaf_value>` \- Computes the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) based on the genotype likelihoods.
-   `gl <genotype_likelihood_method>` \- Specifies the method used for calculating genotype likelihoods.
-   `C <base_quality_adjustment>` \- Adjusts the base quality score by a specified value before using it.
-   `minQ <min_base_quality>` \- Sets the minimum base quality score required.
-   `minmapq <min_mapping_quality>` \- Sets the minimum mapping quality score required.
-   `fold <fold_value>` \- Indicates whether you are analyzing folded SFS or unfolded SFS.
-   `out <output_file>` \- Specifies the output file path and name.
-   `ref <reference_fasta_file>` \- Specifies the reference fasta file.
-   `r <region_of_interest>` \- Specifies the region of interest. ANGSD does not differentiate the chromosomes if you run the whole genome at once, that is why we need to use the ‘region’ variable when running ANGSD to specify the chromosome/scaffold. This will be useful to look the heterozygosity throughout the genome.

Also, make sure you understand each option in the realSFS command line:

-   `nsites <number_of_sites>` \- Specifies the number of sites to be considered for the estimation. 
-   `<input_saf_idx_file>` \- Specifies the input .saf.idx file, which is the output from the ANGSD program that contains information about the SFS.
-   `> <output_est_ml_file>` \- Specifies the output file path and name for the maximum likelihood estimate of the SFS.


#### b) Prepare files and plot heterozygosity along the scaffold

Now let's prepare the `est.ml` files for plotting. The script below will combine the results for the two samples, and add the sample name and scaffold number for each line in our output. This will make our work easier when we want to plot our results.
Copy this script to the server, replace `YOUR_USERNAME` by your Anvil userneme and run it using `sbatch`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --mail-user=x-YOUR_USERNAME@anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=all   # Send email to above address at begin and end of job

# Set the input and output directories
input_directory="/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/heterozygosity"
output_directory="/home/x-YOUR_USERNAME/heterozygosity"

# Define the list of sample IDs (space-separated)
SAMPLES="CH0893 SE2109"

# Create or clear the final concatenated output file
output_file="${output_directory}/genome_wide_het_concatenated.txt" > "${output_file}"

# Loop through the sample IDs
for SAMPLE in $SAMPLES; do
    # Loop through scaffolds 11 to 14
    for i in {11..14}; do
        # Define the current file path
        input_file="${output_directory}/${SAMPLE}.chr_${i}.est.ml"

        # Check if the input file exists
        if [ -f "${input_file}" ]; then
            # Calculate the number of lines in the current file
            num_lines=$(wc -l < "${input_file}")

            # Add the number of lines, sample name, and scaffold number to each line of the output file
            awk -v lines="${num_lines}" -v sample="${SAMPLE}" -v scaffold="${i}" '{print lines, sample, "chr_" scaffold, $0}' "${input_file}" > "${output_directory}/${SAMPLE}.chr_${i}.est.ml.annotated"

            # Move the annotated file to the original file
            mv "${output_directory}/${SAMPLE}.chr_${i}.est.ml.annotated" "$input_file"

            # Concatenate the annotated file to the final output file
            cat "${input_file}" >> "${output_file}"
        else
            echo "Warning: File ${input_file} not found, skipping." >&2
        fi
    done
done
```

Plot the results for the four chromosomes and two individuals using R:

```r
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse) # Collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization
library(viridis)   # Package for generating color palettes
library(scales)    # Package for scaling and formatting axis labels

# Read the data
het_master <- read.table("path/to/genome_wide_het_concatenated.txt")

# Data manipulation
het_master <- het_master %>%
  rename(sample = V2, chromosome = V3) %>%
  mutate(heterozygosity = V5 / (V4 + V5)   # Calculate heterozygosity as V5 / (V4 + V5)
  ) %>%
  group_by(sample, chromosome) %>%      # Group by sample and chromosome
  mutate(position = row_number()               # Assign sequential numbers within each group
  ) %>%
  ungroup()                             # Remove the grouping after calculating position

# Plot all chromosomes
barplot <- ggplot(het_master, aes(x = position, y = heterozygosity)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = factor(chromosome)), width = 1) + # Bar plot with 'identity' stat
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + # Use viridis color palette for the bars
  facet_grid(chromosome ~ sample, scales = "free_x") + # Facet by chromosome on the y-axis and sample on the x-axis
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Heterozygosity\n") + # Label the y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + # Format y-axis with commas
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) + # Format x-axis with commas
  theme_minimal() + # Apply a minimal theme
  theme(
    legend.position = "none", # Remove the legend
    strip.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"), # Make x-axis facet labels bold
    strip.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"), # Make y-axis facet labels bold
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), # Remove x-axis gridlines
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(), # Remove minor x-axis gridlines
    panel.spacing.x = unit(0, "line"), # Set panel spacing to zero
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 0.25) # Add black borders around panels
  )

print(barplot)
ggsave("genome_wide_het.png", units = "in", width = 10, height = 5)
```
