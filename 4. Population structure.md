# PCA and Admixture 

We will use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and estimate individual admixture proportions with Admixture to investigate population structure. 

## Principle Component Analysis

### Load data

First, we will investigate population structure using principal component analysis. 

- PCA aims to identify the main axes of variation in a dataset with each axis being independent of the next. The first component summarizes the major axis variation and the second the next largest, and so on, until all the cummulative variation is explained. 
- For genomic data, PCA summarizes the major axes of variation in allele frequencies

To perform PCA, we will use plink (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/), a useful program to analyze population genomic data. 

## Setting us up for analyses

First, lets make a new directory for our analyses. 

```
mkdir /scratch/genomics/YOURNAME/smsc_2024/pop_structure/
mkdir /home/YOURNAME/smsc_2024/day5
```
